        <h1>Good Enough is Enough</h1>
        <p>An aspect I struggle with in both coding and any other project I work on is allowing 
            myself to submit work that’s not quite perfect. I seem to get stuck on the small details 
            and trying to follow a certain sequence in order to complete a project. What ends up happening
            is something akin to this:
            <img src="horse incomplete.png">
            Where I start off strongly and add as much details as I can, then as a deadline approaches, I am
            forced to complete the project in a way that is less than desirable. When in reality if I had tried
            to get a comprehensive view of the project and complete a rough sketch then get the more specific
            detail done it would get to a “good enough” stage without any sloppy sections.</p>
        <p>Following the same vein, I like to try to accomplish as much as requested, and if I have a client 
            asking me to perform a task I would want to do as much as possible. But I need to be able to give
            a more realistic view of what can be done in a certain amount of time, with the resources I have.
            I as the programmer would need to tell the client what pros and cons exist for different options, 
            while listening to their input.</p>
