        <h1>Mock Voluteer Wireframes</h1>
        <h2>Home page</h2>
        <img src="images/Homescreen frame.png">
        <p>When creating this image I rearranged the location of 
            the login section and pretty much everything else multiple 
            times. I honestly didn't realize how hard it would be to make
            everything flow.

        <h2>Calendar</h2>
        <img src="images/Calendar frame.png">
        <p>For the calendar I imagined a monthly view calender, when one
            clicks on a date a list view pops up with all the events for
            the week. This was a little easier to make, but I would still
            have to consider if the calendar would open from a link or be
            on a seperate page.
